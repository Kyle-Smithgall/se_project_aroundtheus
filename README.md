### Overview

- Photo portfolio
- Responsive development
- Minimalist design

**Intro**

This project showcases my knowledge of responsive web development within the format of a photography portfolio. While the design is not yet interactive, the hover effects indicate where the user will be able to edit, add photos, and like images on the page. Feel free to manipulate the size of your browser window, or view the site on a different device. The page will be responsive from 320px to 1280px resolution.

**Future Improvements**

- Adding interactive elements to the page. Allowing for photos to be added and the profile section to be edited.
- Adding multiple profile/folder options. Maybe the user can have different categories to organize their photos.
- Adding a feature that allows the user to click and expand a certain image in their browser window.
- With the edit functionality, maybe the user can manipulate the order in which the photos are displayed on the page.
